# Synthetic Graph Generator

Script to generate synthetic graphs for my undergraduate research project: Recognizing Power-Law Graphs by Machine Learning Algorithms.

## How to generate the graphs
* Chose function `gen_<type>_graph` and give the quantity of graphs in the parameter. Those functions will generate graphs from [NetworkX](https://networkx.org/)

## Data files
* The results will be saved on `data` directory with as a .gexf file
